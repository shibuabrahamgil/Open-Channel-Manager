## Open-Source Online Hotel Distribution Channel Manager Web-based Software and Application Interface (API)

This is an open-source project for an hotel channel management software, which is implemented using PHP and Laravel Framework. 

It is often difficult to provide two-way interfaces for all of the available online travel agencies and property management systems. Each of such system unfortunately have different specifications without standardization and most of them lacks easily accessible documentation.

Hence, we believe that collaboration on this project with other developers would be helpful and we encourage them to contribute to the development of this open-source web-based online hotel distribution software.
